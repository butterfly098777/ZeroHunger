            <p><i>Number affected:</i> Approximately 670 million people live in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $2.15 per day. This lack of income makes it difficult to afford adequate food.
              Impact: Hunger can trap people in a cycle of poverty, as it weakens their ability to work and earn an income.</p>

    <h3>
    It's important to remember that these are just some of the groups most affected by hunger. The reality is that anyone can be vulnerable to hunger, depending on their circumstances.

    By raising awareness of who is experiencing hunger and the complex factors that contribute to it, we can work towards finding solutions and building a world where everyone has access to sufficient, nutritious food.

<h3>Remember, Zero Hunger is not just a goal; it's a movement. It requires unwavering commitment, collaborative action, and a shared vision for a future where everyone has access to the nutritious food they need to thrive.
<br>
  The journey towards Zero Hunger is paved with challenges, but every small step counts. By embracing innovative solutions, fostering inclusive partnerships, and nurturing a culture of respect for food and its sources, we can cultivate a world where the empty stomach becomes a relic of the past and sustainable nourishment becomes a reality for all.</h3>
